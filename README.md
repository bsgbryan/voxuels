# VoxÃ¼els

Hi there ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to VoxÃ¼els; the super fast, efficient, easy-ti-use voxel engine that's built to work *with* Unreal Engine's best features, not *replace* them!

**NOTE** Before thinking of hte super-cool name, VoxÃ¼els, I named the project "Voxels" (pedestrian, I know). My understanding is that trying to rename an Unreal project is a bad idea, so decided to create this *new* project. The unfortunate side effect is that all the glorious version history contained in the Voxels project is now lost to history ... Thankfully, there's still plenty of work to do!
