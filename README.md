# VoxÃ¼els

Hi there ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to VoxÃ¼els; the super fast, efficient, easy-to-use voxel engine that's built to work *with* Unreal Engine's best features, not *replace* them!

## Getting started

Before trying to open or build the project, install the [Fast Noise Generator](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/fast-noise-generator) plugin to the engine.

Once the plugin is installed you can open the project like any other; have fun messing around!

**NOTE** A "Starter Content" directory may be added to the project when you first open it. I accidentally left the "Starter Content" toggle checked when I first created the project. I'm looking to see if there's a setting somewhere I can update that stops this from happening. The directory won't hurt anything; it's just unnecessary clutter.
